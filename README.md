# Glowkit
Glowkit is a fork of the legendary [Bukkit API](https://bukkit.org), 
as continued by [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org), intended for use with Glowstone. 
It is not a true successor, but instead includes some updates and additions 
to the Bukkit API which are useful to Glowstone.
For a spiritual successor to the Bukkit API, see [Sponge](https://spongepowered.org).

Plugins designed for the original Bukkit API will continue to run on Glowstone,
and and are likely to build against Glowkit with zero or minimal changes.
